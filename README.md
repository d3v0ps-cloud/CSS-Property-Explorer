# CSS Property Explorer

An interactive web tool that allows developers and designers to experiment with CSS properties in real-time. This tool provides a hands-on way to learn and visualize CSS properties, making it easier to understand their effects and generate the corresponding CSS code.

## Features

- **Interactive Property Selection**: Choose from a wide range of CSS properties including:
  - Layout properties (width, height, margin, padding)
  - Typography (font-size, font-weight, font-family, text-align)
  - Colors and backgrounds
  - Transformations and transitions
  - Box model properties
  - And many more

- **Real-time Preview**: See your changes instantly applied to a demo element

- **Dynamic Controls**: 
  - Slider controls for numeric values
  - Color pickers for color properties
  - Dropdown menus for predefined options
  - Text inputs for complex properties

- **Live CSS Code**: 
  - View the generated CSS code in real-time
  - Syntax-highlighted code display
  - One-click copy functionality

## How to Use

1. Select a CSS property from the dropdown menu
2. Use the provided controls to adjust the property's value:
   - Use sliders for properties like width, height, opacity
   - Use color pickers for color-related properties
   - Select from predefined options for properties like display, position
   - Enter custom values for complex properties like box-shadow
3. See the changes reflected immediately in the preview area
4. Copy the generated CSS code using the "Copy" button

## Technical Implementation

  - Flexbox for component alignment
  - Custom scrollbar styling
  - Smooth transitions and animations

## Browser Support
